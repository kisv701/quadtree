# Quadtree 

Python quadtree implementation written as a learning exercise. It should not be taken too seriously and the whole implementation is self contained within 1 file.
So if you for any want a python implementation of a Quadtree, feel free to copy and paste quadtree.py into your project.

The whole implementation is in the quadtree/quadtee.py file.
Example usage is available in example/draw_quadtree.py and example/draw_quadtree_query.py
