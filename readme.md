# Quadtree 

Python quadtree implementation written as a learning exercise. It should not be taken too seriously and the whole implementation is self contained within 1 file.
If you for any reason want a python implementation of a Quadtree, feel free to copy and paste quadtree.py into your project. 

A quadtree should allow you to answer a query like 
*Get me all the points within this region*
in log(n) time, here's the wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).

The result could look something like this, where an area between -100 to 100 in x and -100 to 100 in y is covered by a quadtree. The tree has then been queried with a request to get all points within the greem rectangle.

This example is generated by running example/draw_quadtree_query.py


The whole implementation is in the quadtree/quadtee.py file.

Dependencies
* Python 

The queadtree itself does not have any dependencies except for a reasonable python interpreter but for plotting the examples matplotlib is required.

## Usage
Clone the project and run the following

``> python -m example.draw_quadtree_query``
